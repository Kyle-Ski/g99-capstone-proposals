# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.
