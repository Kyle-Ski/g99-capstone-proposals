# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

## Project Description

My project is a mobile app that will help you pack for trips. It will allow you to create multiple "backpacks" that are a complete list of everything you will need for the trip. When you are about to go on a trip, you select the coorisponding backpack and scan the items you are about to pack. The app will then check the picture of items and count the number you have and tell you if you have everything or if you are forgetting a number of items.

## Problem Statement

While packing for a trip, you may forget to include items.

## How will your project solve this problem?

Packr will alleviate the feeling that you forgot something while packing for a trip. By taking a picture of the items you plan to pack, Packr will tell you before hand if you have everything you need, or if you are missing a number of items.

## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a returning user, I want a place to view all of my backpacks.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to create a new backpack for a different hike.
* As a returning user, I want to check the bag I'm currently packing to make sure everyting is in it.
* As a new user, I want a place to sign up so I can store info.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to sign into my own profile.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to edit a backpack.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to delete a backpack
